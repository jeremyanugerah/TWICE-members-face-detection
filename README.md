## About the Project
This project aims to detect the faces of a famous K-pop girl group, TWICE's members using Python and OpenCV. 
Fortunately, OpenCV comes with a lot of pre-trained classsifiers such as classifiers for eyes, faces, smiles, etc. 
These classifiers come in the form of xml files and are located in opencv/data/haarcascades/ folder.
